# Analysis of Total Fare by City Type for Pyber
## Overview
This analysis was performed for the Pyber ride sharing company to provide them with key information on how city type impacts the overall fares collected by the company. To complete this analysis, the ride- and city-data was combined into a single dataset and parsed down into information on three types of cities: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. From here, the data was filtered by date, and analysis was performed on the fares, rides, and drivers for each city type. 
## Results
### Summary Data
As seen in the table below, each city type has distinct differences in total number of rides, driver, and fares collected. Logically, one could assume that the more densely populated areas contribute a higher percentage of rides, and therefore fares, that the less densely populated cities. In fact, the data does agree with this assumption, with Urban areas accounting for 68.4% of total rides included in the data set. Driver count data follows a similar pattern, which Urban areas far ahead of Suburban and Rural areas in total drivers. Knowledge of supply and demand curves allows us to hypothesize that there would be an inverse relationship between rider and driver density and average fare per ride, and again the data agrees. Rural areas outpace the other city types in terms of average fare per ride and average fare per driver.

  We can also determine that, for that data set provided, demand (as interpreted by total fares) does not correlate strongly with date, as the weekly chart below. While there are peaks and troughs, the data does not variate strongly in either direction as the weeks go by.

## Summary
Based on these results, we recommend the following 3 actions for Pyber as they attempt to grow their business and attract new customers.
  1. Pyber should undertake efforts to attract more drivers in the rural areas. While the fare per rider and fare per driver are highest here, it indicates that the number of people searching for rides is not being properly served. Pursuing more drivers will bring the per-ride and per-drive averages down, but it will drive growth for the total fares, meaning higher revenues for the company.
  2. The ratio of driver to riders in urban areas is far too high, with 1.48 drivers per ride taken. This inflated supply of drivers in suppressing average fares per driver, as indicated by the fact that Urban type cities are the only type with a lower per-driver fare average than per-rider fare average. Pyber should look to further advertising to attract more riders, or find ways to decrease the number of drivers available at any given time.
  3. Pyber should look to expand into more suburban cities, as these seem to offer the best balance of riders to drivers. This ensures low wait times for riders and low downtime for drives, leading to better overall satisfaction for all involved with the business. These suburban sized cities also boast the closest per-rider and per-driver fare averages, showing that resources are being allocated in a more efficient manner for the company.
